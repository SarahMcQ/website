# freeCodeCamp Ottawa

## Project overview
This is a collaborative project between the members of the freeCodeCamp Ottawa meetup. We are building our very own freeCodeCamp Ottawa website for our meetup group. The website will contain information about our group, original and links to existing resources, an 'about us' section, and additional features as we go.

If this is your first foray into open source, check out [this awesome resource](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution) on how to get started, and for ideas on what to contribute.
